        "𝑛\n",
        "≥\n",
        "30\n",
        "n≥30 is typically considered adequate), as larger samples ensure the sampling distribution of the mean approaches normality. Second, the samples must be independent, meaning one observation should not influence another. This is crucial in ensuring unbiased results. Third, if sampling is done without replacement, the population should be significantly larger than the sample size (at least 10 times larger) to maintain independence. Lastly, while the original population distribution can be skewed or non-normal, the CLT ensures that the sampling distribution of the mean becomes normal as sample size increases, making statistical inference possible in real-world scenarios."
